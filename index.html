                <h2>About me</h2>
                <p>I am a passionate graphic designer with a strong foundation in visual communication, branding, and digital design. Over the past 5years, I’ve worked on a variety of projects including logo design, social media content, posters, marketing materials, and UI mockups. My design style is clean, modern, and user-focused, with attention to detail and consistency.

                Currently, I am expanding my skill set as an upcoming web developer, learning front-end technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and exploring responsive design, accessibility. My goal is to bridge the gap between design and development—creating websites that are not only visually engaging but also functional and user-friendly.

                This portfolio highlights selected works that reflect both my design capabilities and my growing technical skills in web development.</p>

                    From modern and minimalistic marks to more expressive and illustrative styles, these designs reflect a deep understanding of typography, color theory, and symbolism. My process involves thorough research, sketching, and digital refinement to deliver logos that are both memorable and adaptable across platforms.

                    These logos are more than visuals—they are the foundation of a brand’s visual identity, designed to leave a lasting impression.</p>
